Project: TypeScript


This project encompasses a series of tasks that delve into various aspects of TypeScript, ranging from fundamental concepts like interfaces and classes to more advanced topics including modules and type checking.


Key Topics Covered
Interfaces and Classes: Explore the world of TypeScript interfaces and classes, understanding how they contribute to creating robust and scalable code.

Modules: Learn the best practices for organizing your codebase using modules, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

Advanced Types: Tackle advanced type-related challenges, including declaration merging, string literal types, and more.

Namespaces and Declaration Merging: Understand the concepts of namespaces and declaration merging, essential for structuring large-scale TypeScript applications.

Ambient Declarations: Dive into ambient declarations, creating type definitions for third-party libraries, enhancing the TypeScript development experience.

Webpack and Tooling Integration: Integrate TypeScript with Webpack and explore essential tooling, ensuring a smooth and efficient development workflow.

Tasks
Task 0: Creating an interface for a student <a name="task-0"></a>
In this task, we create an interface named Student and render a table with student information.

Task 1: Let's build a Teacher interface <a name="task-1"></a>
This task involves building a Teacher interface with specific attributes and exploring object flexibility.

Task 2: Extending the Teacher class <a name="task-2"></a>
Extend the Teacher interface to create a new interface named Directors with additional attributes.

Task 3: Printing teachers <a name="task-3"></a>
Implement a function printTeacher that prints the first letter of the first name and the full last name of a teacher.

Task 4: Writing a class <a name="task-4"></a>
Create a class named StudentClass with specific methods and describe the class through an interface.

Task 5: Advanced types Part 1 <a name="task-5"></a>
Define two interfaces (DirectorInterface and TeacherInterface) and create classes that implement these interfaces.

Task 6: Creating functions specific to employees <a name="task-6"></a>
Write functions isDirector and executeWork to determine the type of employee and execute corresponding tasks.

Task 7: String literal types <a name="task-7"></a>
Define a string literal type named Subjects and create a function teachClass based on the provided subjects.

Task 8: Ambient Namespaces <a name="task-8"></a>
Build an ambient file for a database library and use it in the main.ts file to interact with the library functions.

Task 9: Namespace & Declaration merging <a name="task-9"></a>
Implement a system using namespaces and declaration merging to structure classes and interfaces related to subjects and teachers.

Task 10: Update task_4/js/main.ts <a name="task-10"></a>
Create and export constants for different subject instances, a Teacher object, and log information for each subject.

Task 11: Brand convention & Nominal typing <a name="task-11"></a>
Define interfaces MajorCredits and MinorCredits with a brand property and create functions to sum major and minor credits.
